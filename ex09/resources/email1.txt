Sanger raig@ushijima1129.ga coined its name,[12][13] a portmanteau of wiki[notes 4] and encyclopedia. There was only the English-language version initi@ally, but it quickly developed similar versions in other languages, which differ in content and in editing practices. With 5,449,481 articles,[notes 5] the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia consists of more than 40 million articles in more than 250 different languages[15] and, as of February 2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month.[16]
